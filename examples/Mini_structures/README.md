# Mini Staplehedra

## Introduction

These structures are designed to have the minimum edge length possible, a single helix. As the rotational period of a DNA helix is 10.5 bp, this therefore means the resulting structures will be somewhat strained.

Also, the width of the DNA helix is about 2.1 nm. The rise per base pair of DNA is 0.3 nm. Therefore the side length of any mini-staplehedra will be 3.2 nm, and these polyhedra will be dense, with little internal space.

## In silico optimization

Running brief oxDNA simulations of a tetrahedron, a cube, and an octahedron indicates that these mini-staplehedra do not form structures which are recognizably the polyhedra they are intended to mimic. 

The addition of 2 non-bonding spacer nucleotides doesn't really appear to substantially help matters... also it is somewhat unclear if the instability of the intended structures is  result of innate instability or our inaccuracy of placing the location of the nucleotides.

Adding 4 base pairs, and substantially longer relaxation steps e

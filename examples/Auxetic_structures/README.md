#Auxetic structures

##Introduction 

If you squeeze a banana it will expand in the direction that is at right angles to the direction of the applied stress. The ratio of the compression size change in the direction of the applied force to the expansion size orthogonal to it is called the Poisson ratio. Most materials have positive Poisson ratio's -- gold, jelly, fruit, bone, wood. But there's no physical law saying that the Poisson ratio *must* be positive. Materials which have negative Poisson ratio are called auxetics, and are sought after for their shock absorbing properties and are used in the armed forces as body armour.

This project will design, simulate, and manufacture an auxetic material using DNA polyhedra. It will use Staplehedra as a design software, with some modifications.

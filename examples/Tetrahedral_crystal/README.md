# Designing amphiphilic DNA polyhedra which crystallize unnder annealing

## Introduction

This example concerns designing crystals which are similar to those developed by Ryan Brady in 2017, in [Crystallization of Amphiphilic DNA C-Stars](
https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00980). The principle idea of this paper is to use cholesterol conjugated nanostars to form crystals. However, the geometric structure of the placement of cholesterol groups can be achieved using a DNA polyhedra with carefully placed overhangs. These overhangs can then bind to a cholesterol bearing strand when annealing the crystal.

## DNA sequences

The DNA sequence of the cholesterol bearing strand is ```5'-GCGTCACGGCGTCG AA 3' - TEG Cholesterol```. Therefore a reasonable overhang sequence is given by ```5'-CGACGCCGTGACGC-3' - tetrahedron```. Therefore the overhang on tetrahedron should have the ```5'``` end facing outwards.
